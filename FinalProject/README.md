* *brief* desciption of project
* if experimental project, instructions for compilation and execution of algorithms
* other relevant info 

We plan to do an implementaiton with the focus our project being parallel algorithms for identifying connected components. The comparitive analysis will be on the following algorithms:
  - Parallel Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Parallel Label Propagation

We plan on implementing them with C++ and OpenMP for our parallel framework.  
The objective is to compare the runtimes of identifying the connected components vs. the overall size of the graphs and the number of connected components in the graph.
